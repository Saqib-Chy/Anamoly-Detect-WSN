# Wireless Sensor Network Intrusion Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning-based framework for detecting and analyzing intrusions in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The primary objective is to enhance network security by identifying various types of attacks, including denial-of-service, sinkhole, and Sybil attacks, using machine learning techniques.

##  Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned, normalized, and encoded network data to ensure accurate traffic analysis and node behavior monitoring.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implemented models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, achieving up to 99.68% detection accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Created insightful visualizations, including feature correlations, energy consumption trends, and attack type distributions, effectively identifying network vulnerabilities.
- **Technology Stack:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), Matplotlib, Seaborn.

##  Project Structure
- **`Anomaly-detect-predict.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- **`streamlit.py`**: Streamlit application for deploying the ML model as a web app.
