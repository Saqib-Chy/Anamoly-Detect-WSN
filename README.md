# Wireless Sensor Network Intrusion Analysis
##Project Overview-

This project focuses on developing a robust machine learning-based framework for detecting and analyzing intrusions in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The primary objective is to enhance network security by identifying various types of attacks, including denial-of-service, sinkhole, and Sybil attacks, using machine learning techniques.

##Key Features-

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned, normalized, and encoded network data to ensure accurate traffic analysis and node behavior monitoring.

Machine Learning Models: Implemented models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, achieving up to 99.68% detection accuracy.

Visualization: Created insightful visualizations, including feature correlations, energy consumption trends, and attack type distributions, to effectively identify network vulnerabilities.

Technology Stack: Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn), Matplotlib, Seaborn.

##Project Structure-

data/: Contains the raw and preprocessed data files.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

scripts/: Python scripts for data loading, feature engineering, and model training.

visualizations/: Generated plots and graphs for data insights.
